Game Overview
In Turbo Turtle Race, the player is presented with a colorful race track where five turtles are ready to compete. Each turtle has its own distinct color, and the player's task is to bet on which turtle they think will win the race. The race is run on a lane-marked track, with each turtle moving randomly towards the finish line. The turtle that crosses the finish line first wins, and the game shows if the player's bet was correct.

Gameplay Flow:
Placing a Bet:
When the game starts, the player is prompted with an input box to place a bet by choosing a turtleâ€™s color.
Starting the Race:
Once the bet is placed, the race begins. The turtles move at random speeds towards the finish line, and the player's eyes are glued to see if their pick emerges as the winner.
Determining the Winner:
As soon as a turtle crosses the finish line, the race ends. The game checks if the player's turtle won, and if so, the winning turtle will flash three times in celebration.
Ending the Game:
After the race, the player can close the game or restart it to place a new bet and enjoy another race.
